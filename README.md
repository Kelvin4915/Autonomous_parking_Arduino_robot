# Line Following Robot with Arduino

In this project, we aimed to design and build a robot that could follow a black line on a white surface autonomously using an Arduino microcontroller. Our goal was to develop a cost-effective and efficient solution that could be used in an autonomous parking interface using just Infrared (IR) and one Ultrasonic Sensor.
